    details: 'Izuku has dreamt of being a hero all his life—a lofty goal for anyone, but especially challenging for a kid with no superpowers. That’s right, in a world where eighty percent of the population has some kind of super-powered “quirk,” Izuku was unlucky enough to be born completely normal. But that’s not going to stop him from enrolling in one of the world’s most prestigious hero academies. Now, the only thing standing between him and his first class is the academy’s formidable entrance exam—nothing a little private tutoring from the world’s mightiest hero can’t solve.3 votesI agree Watch onlineIn both animes main character is non-gifted personin magical world. both rivals are especialy gifted ones.I am currently following both series and wnjoy them both a great deal. If someone has similar taste they might enjoy the other one.There are a few similarities between the shows, though there are also differences. In Black Clover, the MC is an orphan, unlike Izuku, who was raised in the church where he was found alongside another boy of the same age at infanthood. In the world of Black Clover, everyone has magic, and magic is everything. However, Asta, the MC, is the only person in the entire kingdom, possibly the world, with no magic to speak of what so ever. He has trained his body every of the fifteen years he\'s been alive so that he can fulfill his dream of becoming a magic knight, the protectors of the realm, and becoming Wizard King, the most powerful wizard in the kingdom. Ring any bells? Whats more, the boy who was discovered with Asta by the church is a boy named Yuno who also aspires to become the Wizard King, and has been gifted with incredibly powerful magic. Once a year, ever 15-year-old in the kingdom is givena grimoire, a magical book that records spells and enhances the user\'s magical powers. Asta\'s rival, Yuno, is given an incredibly rare, powerful, and legendary grimoire while Asta, hoping that his grimoire will finally allow him to use magic is instead gifted with a strange and unknown power that carries him through the Magic Nights Exams and intoknighthood. However, his adventures have only just begone and trouble is stirring deep within the Kingdom. To me, this show is both exremely similar to MHA, and yet unique as well.',
