    details: 'Lucy is a seventeen-year-old mage with the power to summon stellar spirits, but what she really wants to do is join a guild - and not just any guild. She has hereyes set on Fairy Tail, a notoriously reckless and outrageous group of magic users who are likely to be drunk or destroying buildings and towns in the process of completing a job! While in town one day Lucy meets a perpetually-seasick boy named Natsu who, through a series of events, reveals to her that he\'s none other than the fire-eating mage Salamander of Fairy Tail! Lucy is finally able to join Fairy Tail and quickly begins to take on odd jobs with Natsu and his gang for fame and profit. Along with her fiery friend, Happy the flying cat, Natsu\'s archrival Gray and their overseer the invincible and beautiful Erza, Lucy sets forth for epic adventures that leave an epic amount of destruction in their wake. After all, destroying a city or five doesn\'t matter as long as they get the job done... right?!18 votesI agree Watch onlineLike Black Clover, Fairy Tail focuseson magic and just like Natsu, Asta is a hot-head who wants to be the most powerful being in the kingdom.I agree because the world in which the two storys live in are both dependent of magic/magic users. Both are mediocre magical shonenes. but Fairy Tail has charm to make up for it and have fun, while black Clover has none.They\'re fun... I guess?I mean both have mystical and/or fantasy components/elements in them, so there\'s that.And they have interesting characters and plot too.So yeah, go check them out.It\'s basicallythe story of One Piece with the dynamics and magic of Fairy Tail. The main character is what you might get combining Natsu and Naruto, His team is basically the fairytale guild and it\'s leader is practically Laxus with black hair and no lightning.Fairy Tail is like Black clover in some character similarities, the general mood, and interpersonal dynamics. Personally, Fairy Tail is funnier, has more compelling arcs (...sometimes) and faster than Black Clover to get into.I agree that this anime is similiar to Magi ... Fairytail .. and NarutoMagi at dungeons ch.11 in Manga Fairy tail of course \'cause of magicNaruto at the thing which called magic knights exam or testBoth are set in worlds where magic is the dominant force and mages are banded together into guilds. Natsu and Asta are also fairly similar in that they are both hot-headed and determined. Both shows are just a ton of Shounen fun!The most obvious similar show. The protagonists are in destructive, infamous but well-intended magic guidsWell the magic is pretty much the same and nastsu and asta are both pretty similar characters. Really similar magic vibes, protagonists equally ridiculous (in a good way). Guilds and Squads have a similar feel. Black Clover is slightly more goal-oriented where Fairy Tail focuses largely on interpersonal bonds, but both have some of each. I would recommend to watch Fairy tail, Naruto , boruto , Bleach , hunterXhunter.These are magic related Anime with interesting stories ..I love both!! Both anime\'s are so so good! Highly recomend. Also, I ship Nalu!!!!!!! Not to mention the story line for both are really well done. Although, they are different on some aspect they have completely different plots and etc. So I highly reccomend you give both a try. They both have magic in them and the main chaerecter is really powerful and has not unlocked his full power yetThey\'re both about magic and are amazing They both show depict how children suffer and not judge others . They both show how to fight for what you believe in How to treat everyone with respect and never let anyone disrespect or bullyanother no matter if you like the person being bullied I agree totally. They both involved magic, and they both have lots of problems that have to be solved or it is the end for them. Especially since they are fighting in both. These stories both tell about friendship and love in my opinion and I am happy I found these.Both main characters are dumbass\' who refuse to lose and fight those who insult or harm their family in any way. And it helps that then and their magic are just crazy 😈😂It both plays in a world of magics. The feeling of friends are like family and the protagonists are very similar. The story is quiet different though, which excludes the feeling that you are watching the same Anime.Fantasy magic show with a badass group of people who use unique magic as the main protagonists.',

    details: 'Izuku has dreamt of being a hero all his life—a lofty goal for anyone, but especially challenging for a kid with no superpowers. That’s right, in a world where eighty percent of the population has some kind of super-powered “quirk,” Izuku was unlucky enough to be born completely normal. But that’s not going to stop him from enrolling in one of the world’s most prestigious hero academies. Now, the only thing standing between him and his first class is the academy’s formidable entrance exam—nothing a little private tutoring from the world’s mightiest hero can’t solve.3 votesI agree Watch onlineIn both animes main character is non-gifted personin magical world. both rivals are especialy gifted ones.I am currently following both series and wnjoy them both a great deal. If someone has similar taste they might enjoy the other one.There are a few similarities between the shows, though there are also differences. In Black Clover, the MC is an orphan, unlike Izuku, who was raised in the church where he was found alongside another boy of the same age at infanthood. In the world of Black Clover, everyone has magic, and magic is everything. However, Asta, the MC, is the only person in the entire kingdom, possibly the world, with no magic to speak of what so ever. He has trained his body every of the fifteen years he\'s been alive so that he can fulfill his dream of becoming a magic knight, the protectors of the realm, and becoming Wizard King, the most powerful wizard in the kingdom. Ring any bells? Whats more, the boy who was discovered with Asta by the church is a boy named Yuno who also aspires to become the Wizard King, and has been gifted with incredibly powerful magic. Once a year, ever 15-year-old in the kingdom is givena grimoire, a magical book that records spells and enhances the user\'s magical powers. Asta\'s rival, Yuno, is given an incredibly rare, powerful, and legendary grimoire while Asta, hoping that his grimoire will finally allow him to use magic is instead gifted with a strange and unknown power that carries him through the Magic Nights Exams and intoknighthood. However, his adventures have only just begone and trouble is stirring deep within the Kingdom. To me, this show is both exremely similar to MHA, and yet unique as well.',

Now, the teen must attend the True Cross Academy and begin special exorcist training alongside his new comrades all while keeping his identity a secret; but can the son of Satan really become a true exorcist?3 votesI agree Watch onlineBoth start with two boys taken in at a church. Both protagonist have goals, that doesn\'t match with their powers, but still try hard to reach their goal. Both have magic and demons, and have quirky protagonist with a close rival/relative, that is much better and skilled than they are. The protagonists use raw strength and will-power, and have dangerous powers. I agree because they are both about a character that is determaned and faithful of a demon. Black Clover and Blue Exorcist contain unsur-unsur berbau Demon/Lucifer/whatever. Juga sihir-sihir',

If you like underdog stories with action and goofy characters these are both really good fits. Black clover and Naruto.. Both have stupid and loud main characters who are at start very, very weak, but they are both training hard and want to become something what others dont think they will ever be: Naruto - hokage and Asta - Wizard king.',
